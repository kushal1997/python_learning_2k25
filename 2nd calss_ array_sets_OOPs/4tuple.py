# Tuple is an ordered collection of elements in programming. It is immutable, meaning its elements cannot be changed once created.
# Tuples can store different data types, and their elements can be accessed through indexing.
# They are useful for representing fixed sets of values or returning multiple values from a function.

p_data = ("Kushal", 27, "INDIA")
